These are some of the talks that probably influenced me the most in my career as a software developer.

I made this list mostly for myself to go back and rewatch from time to time. I hope it's usefull for other devs who maybe did not stumble uppon these talks and people.

The order is chronological on the year the talks were delivered.

## 1. [Douglas Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) - The Mother of All Demos (1968)

{{< youtube yJDv-zdhzMY >}}

[Douglas Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) was a visionary computer scientist who pioneered many of the concepts and technologies that we use today. He is best known for his 1968 demonstration, dubbed "The Mother of All Demos", where he showcased the first mouse, hypertext, video conferencing, collaborative editing, and more.

Engelbart's work was driven by his goal of augmenting human intellect and solving complex problems. He believed that computers could be used as tools to enhance human capabilities and facilitate collective intelligence. He founded the [Augmentation Research Center (ARC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_Research_Center) at [Stanford Research Institute (SRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International), where he led a team of researchers and engineers to develop innovative systems and software.

Engelbart's influence in software engineering is immense. He invented or contributed to many of the paradigms and principles that are still relevant today, such as graphical user interfaces, bootstrapping, and user-centered design. He also inspired generations of computer scientists and innovators, such as [Alan Kay](#2-alan-kay---the-computer-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-oopsla-1997), Tim Berners-Lee, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates.

Engelbart's 1968 demo is widely regarded as one of the most influential talks in the history of computing. It is a must-watch for any developer who wants to learn about the origins and evolution of computing, as well as the vision and philosophy behind it.

## 2. Alan Kay - The computer revolution hasnt happened yet (OOPSLA 1997)

{{< youtube oKg1hTOQXoY >}}

Alan Kay is a pioneering figure in the field of computer science, best known for his groundbreaking work in object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces. Kay's innovative thinking has shaped modern computing as we know it today.

After earning his Ph.D. from the University of Utah, Kay joined Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) in the 1970s. It was here where he made several of his most influential contributions to the field. His vision of a "personal computer" - an idea encapsulated in his famous Dynabook concept - was transformative and prophetic.

Kay was one of the key architects of the Smalltalk programming language, the first truly object-oriented language that has influenced numerous other languages, including Java, Python, and Ruby. His work in developing graphical user interfaces has underpinned their ubiquitous presence in modern computing, from desktops to smartphones.

In 2003, Kay received the prestigious Turing Award, often considered the "Nobel Prize of Computing," for his wide-ranging and enduring contributions to the field. Beyond his technical achievements, Alan Kay is renowned for his ability to blend computer science with cognitive psychology, educational theory, and design thinking - a holistic approach that continues to inspire the next generation of innovators. Despite his numerous accomplishments, Kay remains an active voice in technology, pushing the boundaries and exploring new ways to improve how we interact with computers.

## 3. Rich Hickey - Simple Made Easy (2011)

{{< youtube LKtk3HCgTa8 >}}

Rich Hickey is a prominent figure in the software engineering world, known for creating the Clojure programming language and the Datomic database system. He has over 20 years of experience in various domains, such as scheduling, broadcast automation, audio analysis, database design, and machine learning. He is also a prolific speaker and writer, who has delivered influential talks and papers on topics such as functional programming, concurrency, data structures, and software design.

## 4. Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle (2012)

{{< youtube PUv66718DII >}}

Bret Victor is a visionary interface designer, computer scientist, and electrical engineer who has been pushing the boundaries of the dynamic medium for over a decade. He is the founder and lead of Dynamicland, a research lab that aims to create a humane real-world computational medium for deep understanding. He is also known for his influential talks and essays on the future of technology, such as Inventing on Principle, The Future of Programming, and Explorable Explanations.

Victor's work is driven by a passion for making it easier and faster to use complex tools and ideas. He has invented novel interfaces for understanding and creating systems, such as interactive data graphics, live coding environments, and spatial programming languages. He has also contributed to the design and engineering of several products, such as the Alesis Ion synthesizer, the Apple iPad, Apple Watch, and Al Gore's Our Choice app.

Victor's impact in the field of software engineering is undeniable. He has inspired countless programmers, designers, educators, and researchers with his vision of a more expressive, humane, and powerful medium for thinking and communicating. He has challenged the status quo of software development and proposed new principles and paradigms for creating software that serves human needs and values. He has demonstrated the potential of dynamic media to transform how we see, understand, and create systems.

## 5. Robert C Martin - Clean Architecture and Design (2013)

{{< youtube Nsjsiz2A9mg >}}

Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, is a renowned software engineer, instructor, and author who has contributed significantly to the field of software engineering. 

He is one of the authors and signatories of the Agile Manifesto, a set of principles and values that guide agile software development. He is also the creator of the SOLID principles, a collection of best practices for designing and maintaining object-oriented software. 

He has written several books on agile software development, software craftsmanship, and software design, such as Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices; Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship; and Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design. 

He is the founder and president of Uncle Bob Consulting and Clean Coders, which provide consulting and training services to software professionals. He is widely respected and influential in the software community for his expertise, experience, and passion for software quality.

No matter what you think about the person Uncle Bob, this talk is a good one. It was one of the first talks that got me to understand the ideas of dependency inversion, boundaries, and how you could design loose coupled systems.

## 6. Joe Armstrong - The Mess We're In (2014)

{{< youtube lKXe3HUG2l4 >}}

Joe Armstrong was a pioneer in software engineering who created the Erlang programming language, a concurrent, functional, and fault-tolerant language that powers many distributed systems today. He was motivated by the need to build reliable and scalable telecom applications that could handle millions of users without downtime. He also developed a design methodology and a set of libraries called OTP that provide common patterns and tools for building robust systems with Erlang. He wrote a book called Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World, which is a comprehensive introduction to the language and its features. 

He was also a professor at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, where he supervised research on distributed systems and programming languages. He died in 2019, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and inspiration for the software engineering community.

## 7. Patrick Winston - How to Speak (2018)

{{< youtube Unzc731iCUY >}}

Patrick Winston was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and a professor at MIT for over 50 years. He made significant contributions to the areas of natural language understanding, computer vision, machine learning, and human intelligence. He also influenced generations of students and researchers through his teaching, mentoring, and writing.

This is not directly about programming, but I think presenting ideas is something that all developers should learn how to do properly.
