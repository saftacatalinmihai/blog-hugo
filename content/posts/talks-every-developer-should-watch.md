In the rapidly evolving world of software development, it's easy to get lost in the sea of new languages, frameworks, and techniques. But as I journeyed through my career as a developer, I found that revisiting seminal talks from industry visionaries consistently provides me with fresh perspectives and enduring wisdom. I compiled this list, initially for myself but now for all of you, to share these invaluable resources that continue to shape my work. If you're a developer eager to broaden your horizons or someone curious about the minds that pioneered our field, these seven talks are for you.

## 1. Bret Victor - The Future of Programming (2013)

{{< vimeo 71278954 >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="The most dangerous taught that you can have as a creative person" open=false >}}
is to think that you know what you're doing. Because once you think you know what you're doing, you stop looking around for other ways of doing things.

[Bret Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Victor) is a visionary interface designer, computer scientist, and electrical engineer who has been pushing the boundaries of the dynamic medium for over a decade. 
He is the founder and lead of [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/), a research lab that aims to create a humane real-world computational medium for deep understanding.

He has also contributed to the design and engineering of several products, such as the Alesis Ion synthesizer, the Apple iPad, Apple Watch, and Al Gore's Our Choice app.

I have 2 of Bret's talks on this list - that shows how much value I get from his talks. I would, of course, recommend all of them. You can find more on [worrydream](http://worrydream.com/).

This first talk is a bit of a history lesson in past ideas on hardware and software. It's a good introduction for the following talks.

The next talk is mentioned in this one. It's the full demo of [NSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)).

## 2. Douglas Engelbart - The Mother of All Demos (1968)

{{< youtube yJDv-zdhzMY >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="If in your office, you as an intellectual worker" open=false >}}
were supplied with a computer display backed up by a computer that was alive for you all day and was instantly responsive to every action you had, how much value can you derive from that?
{{< /admonition >}}

[Douglas Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) was a computer scientist who pioneered many of the concepts and technologies that we use today. He is best known for this 1968 demonstration, dubbed "The Mother of All Demos", where he showcased the first computer mouse, video conferencing, teleconferencing, hypertext, word processing, hypermedia, object addressing and dynamic file linking, bootstrapping, and a collaborative real-time editor.

This talk may seem boring to watch at times - showing how to reorder lists of text for instance - things that are generally well-known and easy to do today. But you have to remember that these things **did not exist** at that time... He had to invent it all.

Engelbart's work was driven by his goal of augmenting human intellect and solving complex problems. He believed that computers could be used as tools to enhance human capabilities and facilitate collective intelligence. He founded the [Augmentation Research Center (ARC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_Research_Center) at [Stanford Research Institute (SRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International), where he led a team of researchers and engineers to develop innovative systems and software.

He inspired generations of computer scientists and innovators including the author of the next talk: [Alan Kay](#3-alan-kay---the-computer-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-oopsla-1997)

## 3. Alan Kay - The computer revolution hasn't happened yet (OOPSLA 1997)

{{< youtube oKg1hTOQXoY >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="I invented the term Object Oriented" open=false >}}
and I can tell you I didn't have C++ in mind
{{< /admonition >}}

[Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) is a pioneering figure in the field of computer science, best known for his groundbreaking work in [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and [graphical user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). Kay's innovative thinking has shaped modern computing as we know it today.

Kay joined [Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PARC_(company)) in the 1970s. It was here where he made several of his most influential contributions to the field. His vision of a "personal computer" - an idea encapsulated in his famous [Dynabook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook) concept - was transformation and prophetic.

Kay was one of the key architects of the [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) programming language, the first truly object-oriented language. His work in developing graphical user interfaces has underpinned their ubiquitous presence in modern computing, from desktops to smartphones.

In 2003, Kay received the prestigious Turing Award, often considered the "Nobel Prize of Computing," for pioneering many of the ideas at the root of contemporary object-oriented programming languages, leading the team that developed Smalltalk, and for fundamental contributions to personal computing.

In this talk, Kay challenged the audience to rethink their understanding of computers and technology, arguing that the true potential of computing was far from being realized.

## 4. Joe Armstrong - The Mess We're In (2014)

{{< youtube lKXe3HUG2l4 >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="I think software is actually getting worse and worse and worse with time." open=false >}}
It's not that we can't do amazing things with computers. We can. But when they don't work, we can't understand why it did.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="" open=false >}}
you shouldn't write systems that violate laws of physics
{{< /admonition >}}

[Joe Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)) was a pioneer in software engineering who created the [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) programming language, a concurrent, functional, and fault-tolerant language that powers many distributed systems today. He was motivated by the need to build reliable and scalable telecom applications at Ericsson that could handle millions of users without downtime. He also developed a design methodology and a set of libraries called [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform) that provide common patterns and tools for building robust systems with [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/). 

In this talk, Joe asks what went wrong with programming, given that hardware has improved soo much in the past half century, yet is seems that software is a lot slower than it should be just given CPU speedup in MHz and #processors, and also breaks all the time.

## 5. Rich Hickey - Simple Made Easy (2011)

{{< youtube LKtk3HCgTa8 >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="Simplicity is a choice." open=false >}}
It's your fault if you don't have a simple system. And I think we have a culture of complexity. To the extent we all continue to use these tools that have complex outputs, we're just in a rut.
{{< /admonition >}}

[Rich Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey) is a prominent figure in the software engineering world, known for creating the [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) programming language and the [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/) database system. He has over 20 years of experience in various domains, such as scheduling, broadcast automation, audio analysis, database design, and machine learning. He is also a prolific speaker and writer, who has delivered influential talks and papers on topics such as functional programming, concurrency, data structures, and software design.

In this talk, Rich argues that we should pursue simplicity, not ease of use, in software design and avoid complexity by choosing simple tools and constructs and carefully separating concerns.

## 6. Stephen Wolfram - A New Kind of Science

{{< youtube _eC14GonZnU >}}

[Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram) is a renowned computer scientist, physicist, and entrepreneur known for his work in cellular automata, complexity theory, and computational knowledge. 

He is the creator of Mathematica, a comprehensive computational software, and Wolfram Alpha, an innovative online computational knowledge engine that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data. 

Wolfram's theoretical work includes his explorations into the nature of complexity in the natural world, best illustrated in his book, "A New Kind of Science". This work introduced the [principle of computational equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_New_Kind_of_Science#Principle_of_computational_equivalence) and argued that the universe itself might be understood as a simple computational process. He recently developed this theory in the [Wolfram Physics Project](https://www.wolframphysics.org/). 

Despite his contentious role in the scientific community due to his unconventional approaches, his contributions have undeniably expanded the horizon of computational science.

## 7. Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle (2012)

{{< youtube EGqwXt90ZqA >}}

## Bonus: Patrick Winston - How to Speak (2018)

{{< youtube Unzc731iCUY >}}

[Patrick Winston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston) was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and a professor at MIT for over 50 years. He made significant contributions to the areas of natural language understanding, computer vision, machine learning, and human intelligence. He also influenced generations of students and researchers through his teaching, mentoring, and writing.

This is not directly about programming, but I think presenting ideas is something that all developers should learn how to do properly.
