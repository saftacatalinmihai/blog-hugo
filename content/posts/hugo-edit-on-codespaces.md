**What if you could write and preview your blog from anywhere, using nothing more than a web browser?**

Picture this: You're sitting in a café, inspiration strikes, and you want to write a blog post. But your laptop is at home, your development environment is locked away, and you're stuck with just a tablet. Most developers would bookmark the idea and wait until they're back at their workstation.

But what if there was a better way?

## The Challenge: Writing Without Boundaries

My setup for working on this blog is unconventional—I write on a tablet, not my main computer. This means I can't directly run the Hugo server locally, can't see live previews of my changes, and can't easily manage the typical development workflow that most static site generators assume.

This constraint forced me to find a solution that would work from anywhere, on any device, without sacrificing the ability to preview changes in real-time.

## The Solution: GitHub Codespaces as a Development Environment

I decided to use GitHub Codespaces for editing the blog and run it as a development server so I can view the edited pages after making changes. This approach transforms any device with a web browser into a full-featured development environment.

Here's what makes this workflow powerful:

- **Universal Access**: Write from any device, anywhere
- **Real-time Preview**: See changes instantly in the browser
- **Zero Setup**: No local installation required
- **Collaboration**: Easy sharing and review process

## Implementation Resources

Here are some of the links with tutorials I followed to accomplish this:

This setup has revolutionized my writing workflow, turning constraints into opportunities and proving that the best development environment is the one that adapts to your life, not the other way around.
