Let's say you have a service that runs a number of steps for it's business process. 
One of those steps consumes high CPU - something to do with cryptographic functions let's say.
You run this service on 3 nodes ( you need 3 at least for high availability, no less )
You get concerned that with increasing traffic to this service the CPU starts to go above 89-90%.

What are your options ?
One answer comes from the much praised solution of using microservices and scale them independently.
