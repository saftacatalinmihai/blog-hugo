### Ideas
- Drawing an owl - start with 2 circles - draw the rest of the owl  - this is how software is built now.
Someone - architect or senior dev - starts by drawing diagrams that is not actually code running, it's just a diagram.
Then devs take that diagram and start implementing it - and don't update the diagrams to keep the actual running code in sync with the drawing representation.
