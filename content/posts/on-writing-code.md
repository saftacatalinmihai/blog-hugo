**What if I told you that the difference between good code and great code has nothing to do with syntax, algorithms, or performance—and everything to do with storytelling?**

Most developers would laugh at this claim. Code is logical. Code is mathematical. Code is the ultimate expression of pure, mechanical thinking.

But here's the uncomfortable truth: If coding were truly mechanical, we'd all write identical solutions to the same problems. We'd have no need for code reviews, no heated debates about architecture, no such thing as "elegant" or "ugly" code.

The reality is far more nuanced—and far more human.

## The Agile Illusion: Code as Assembly Line

If you work as a developer in a big company today, you know the agile process of having stories that you work on, and have to deliver code during the sprint. Hopefully by the end of the sprint you can also demo the working feature.

This style kind of assumes that you will write the code fully fleshed out in one go, and be done with it—like installing a part on an assembly line. Requirements go in, code comes out. Simple, predictable, mechanical.

But anyone who's written code knows this isn't how it actually works.

## The Writer's Truth: Code as Creative Expression

Writing code is not a mechanistic activity where you turn clear specifications into code. There are infinity ways of implementing a feature—infinite ways to structure the logic, infinite ways to name variables, infinite ways to organize the flow.

Writing code is more like writing poetry—you have a goal of inspiring the reader to imagine scenes and feel emotions, and you are also constrained by the rules of poetry (verses have to rhyme).

Consider this: When you read someone else's code, you're not just parsing logic. You're trying to understand their thought process, their intentions, their mental model of the problem. Good code tells a story. Great code tells a story so compelling that future developers (including your future self) can step into the narrative and continue writing.

## The Author's Process: How Code Should Be Written

It should be similar to the process of writing a book:

- **You start out with a rough draft.** When writing the draft you start changing the story to make it more believable or the characters to make them feel more authentic.

- **After finishing the first draft, you re-read it and change it some more**—take out insignificant details, change the structure of the plot-line, add supporting characters etc...

- **After you're happy with the book you send it to a publisher to review it.** They usually send feedback that you incorporate into the work. This goes back and forth until both you and the publisher are happy with the result.

This is how software should be written as well—more like writing a book.

## The Corporate Reality: When Art Meets Deadline

We are stuck in a loop of product owners demanding features out the door as quickly as possible. This never allows us to reflect on the code, try out different designs, refactoring for a better structure.

In this environment, we're not writers—we're stenographers, frantically transcribing requirements into code without time to craft, polish, or perfect.

But what if we reclaimed the creative process? What if we treated code as the literary work it truly is?

The best code doesn't just work—it tells a story worth reading.
