If you work as a developer in a big company today, you know the agile process of having stories that you work on, and have to deliver code during the sprint. Hopefully by the end of the sprint you can also demo the working feature

This style kind of assumes that you will write the code fully fleshed out in one go, and be done with it.

Writing code is not a mechanistic activity where you turn clear specifications into code. There are infinity ways of implementing a feature.

Writing code is more like writing poetry - you have a goal of inspiring the reader to imagine scenes and feel emotions, and you are also constrained by the rules of poetry (verses have to rhyme).

It should be similar to the process of writing a book:

- You start out with a rough draft. When writing the draft you start changing the story to make it more believable or the characters to make them feel more authentic.

- After finishing the first draft, you re-read it and change it some more - take out insignificant details, change the structure of the plot-line, add supporting characters etc...

- After you're happy with the book you send it to a publisher to review it. They usually send feedback that you incorporate into the work. This goes back and forth until both you and the publisher are happy with the result.

This is how software should be written as well - more like writing a book.

We are stuck in a loop of product owners demanding features out the door as quickly as possible. This never allows us to reflect on the code, try out different designs, refactoring for a better structure.
