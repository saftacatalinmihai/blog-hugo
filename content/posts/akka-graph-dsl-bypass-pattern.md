**What if your streaming system could be smart enough to remember what work it's already done?**

Imagine this scenario: A critical message flows through your stream processing pipeline. It gets processed by the first three stages successfully, then suddenly—network failure. The message is redelivered from the beginning, but now you're faced with a problem: how do you avoid redoing work that's already been completed?

This is where idempotency becomes not just a nice-to-have feature, but a necessity for robust systems.

## The Problem: Partial Processing in Streaming Systems

When working with Akka Streams, you might find yourself in a situation where you need to bypass a stage in the graph. This isn't about optimization—it's about correctness.

Consider a real-world scenario:
- A payment processing stream with validation, fraud detection, and settlement stages
- The message fails after fraud detection but before settlement
- Upon retry, you want to skip the already-completed validation and fraud detection
- But you still need to complete the settlement

This is a good pattern if we want the whole stream to be idempotent. If we get the same message again, we want the stream to be able to process it—but only the stages that were not already processed.

## The Solution: Smart Stage Bypassing

The key insight is to design your stream with "checkpoints"—points where you can safely restart processing without repeating expensive or side-effect-producing operations.

We usually save the extra information after each processing stage. At the start of the stream we can get the state for a message, allowing us to determine which stages to skip and which to execute.

This pattern transforms a fragile, all-or-nothing pipeline into a resilient, stateful system that can gracefully handle failures and retries.
