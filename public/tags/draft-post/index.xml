    <description><![CDATA[Let&rsquo;s say you have a service that runs a number of steps for it&rsquo;s business process. One of those steps consumes high CPU - something to do with cryptographic functions let&rsquo;s say. You run this service on 3 nodes ( you need 3 at least for high availability, no less ) You get concerned that with increasing traffic to this service the CPU starts to go above 89-90%.
What are your options ?]]></description>

Writing code is not a mechanistic activity where you turn clear specifications into code.]]></description>
